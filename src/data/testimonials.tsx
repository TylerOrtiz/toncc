        name: "Amanda",
        content: "<p>John Ortiz (TON Custom Carpentry) has done extensive work on our home, including the complete demolition and renovation of two bathrooms; replacing walls, flooring, and a ceiling that had been water damaged; and installing a custom curved bannister. The work included plumbing, electrical, drywall, painting, woodwork, and tile work.</p><p>I would strongly, strongly recommend John. He is thorough, detailed, professional, and honest. He spent several hours going over the details of the job before he even bid. That upfront time helped us understand what needed to be done (and could be done), what our options were, and what we should expect as far as time and cost.</p><p>During the job, there were many unexpected issues as the previous owner appeared to have done some plumbing and wiring in the home which was not up to code. Each time this occured, John showed us the issue, explained our options, and gave us a clear understanding of what was needed. There were many times that John did his research on his own time, consulting other experts or picking up a selection of samples.</p><p>John is extremely knowledgeable yet is also curious to learn about new and potentially better techniques or materials. Nothing was ever done because that is the way it had always been done; it was done because it was the right way to do it. John never cut corners.</p><p>The transformation in our home is amazing. The quality and beauty is a reflection of the absolute integrity with which John approaches his work.</p><p>Again, I would strongly recommend John for any renovation jobs, big or small.</p>"

        name: "Gary",
        content: "<p>John Ortiz, principle of TON Construction, built an addition to our home this past year (2007). John designed the addition which included extensive window placements, a beautifully coffered ceiling and flat roof, on which he constructed an upper level deck. The construction required structural details and steel beam supports in order to carry out the design plan.</p><p>John was a pleasure to work with. He and his crew completed the work in a timely fashion. John coordinated the necessary subcontractors with little down time. The craftsmanship of the completed job was excellent and the punch list was extremely short. I would recommend TON construction to anyone wishing a carefully designed and well built addition to their home.<p>"

        name: "Ellen",
        content: "<p>It is with great pleasure that I recommend John Ortiz to you. What first comes to mind about John Ortiz is his integrity, the second is his skills, the third is his professionalism.</p><p>John demolished my old kitchen and made it into a room where I love to be. He attended to every detail and was innovative when things needed to be changed or improved. I could count on John to say \"I can solve that problem\". I consulted him in areas of the renovations far more than I expected because he as a fund of knowledge about anything in homebuilding or renovation.</p><p>I needed to redo my stairs and John found ways to save me money with the purchase of treads, handrails and spindles by finding quality items that did the job for less. John designed and built newels and caps that are a beautiful compliment to my decor. He also did the staining to achieve just the right color of the woodwork. My staircase makes a wonderful statement now.</p><p>John tiled my kitchen floor and a bathroom floor. He made saddles where needed and also did carpentry to weatherproof an entry door that prevented my floors from being scratched.</p><p>It was a pleasure working with John. He is a professional you can trust and with whom you have a working partnership. Our family will miss him and look forward to further endeavors with him.</p>"

        content: "<p>John and his team redid our three bathrooms and then repainted a large part of our home. The quality of their work was exceptional. They were dependable, efficient, and flexible, and we are thrilled with the end result. John was extremely responsive to any issues that surfaced and, as an added plus, did an amazing job of cleaning up at the end of each work day so as to minimize the impact of construction on our home.</p>"

        name: "Albert",
        content: "<p>I want to thank you for the artistic and extremely well executed work that you did in our new home. In particular, the bookcases in our library and the fireplace mantel have been praised by all our friends who have recently visited us. You were very responsive, especially when you did a lot of work in our home before we even occupied it. The ceiling moldings, the preparation of the basement, the installation of the insinkerator, the basement stairs were done with precision and care. All the work was finished impeccably.</p><p>Because of the above, we had no reservation in recommending you to our daughter in Pound Ridge. She has also been extremely satisfied. When we visited her after the work was completed, we were impressed at the transformation which you effected in her home.</p><p>Once again, thank you for your artistry, dedication and responsiveness to our requests. We have no reservation in recommending you to anyone else.</p>"

        name: "Robert",
        content: "<p>We have known John twelve years. We first contracted him to convert our lower level into a suite of offices. He was then and continues to be a hard working, honest, conscientious, meticulous, and reliable worker. Most importantly, he takes great pride in his work and thus always performs his best. He did a beautiful job and the offices are quite beautifully paneled, and the built-in bookcases are a showpiece.</p><p>We were so satisfied that we shortly asked John to build our deck. His artistic talent and creativity were quite evident here. We had already decided that whatever else would be done to our house only John would do it. He demolished our old kitchen and transformed it beautifully into a functional modern kitchen. At the same time we asked him to change and add windows, as well as put in skylights.</p><p>A few years later, we asked John to demolish and renovate our bathrooms. Again, he did a beautiful job. Later that year we had john convert a bedroom into an English study complete with cathedral ceilings, skylight, and new windows. He created a masterpiece by contructing his own paneling.</p><p>Just last year John converted a garage into an exercise room. His last project is a beautiful stone patio. We have complete trust in John and know that he always does his best and will always try to please if it's in our own interest.</p>"

        name: "David",
        content: "<p>I have known John Ortiz for several years and am personally familiar with his work, both through his association with the builder of the subdivision where my home is located as well as the extensive renovation work to my home by John, which has included renovation of the master bathroom, design and installation of floor-to-ceiling built-in bookshelves and cabinets, decorative molding (including crown and chair railings), french doors and repair and restoration of exterior roof soffits. The work performed by John as evidenced in the new houses recently constructed in our subdivision and his work in our home reflect John's meticulous attention to detail.</p><p>In all instances, both my wife and I have been extremely satisfied with the quality and result of his work and have recommended him to friends and colleagues alike.</p><p>John's friendly and professional manner, his understanding of our requirements and the craftsmanship in designing and performing the work are exemplary.</p>"
